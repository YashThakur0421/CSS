        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and
        editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the
        character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.
        Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor,
        Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published
        consistently since the character's creation.

        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the
        weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. When Stark is captured in a war zone and sustains a serious heart wound,
        he builds his iconic Iron Man armor out of scrap and escapes his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him
        superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was used to explore political
        themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil
        unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.</p>

    <h1>Publication history</h1>

    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes.
        The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional
        science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.[5][6] Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron
        Man is Born!", was in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964,
        the science-fiction and horror stories were removed entirely, with the series running only Iron Man and Captain
        America stories.</p>
    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>Iron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for
        his association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War.[4][26] In response, Marvel
        rewrote the character in the 1970s to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in
        the harms caused by war.[28][122] According to Lee, Iron Man was the most popular hero when reading fanmail from
        female readers, which he attributed to both the character's charisma and his tragic nature</p>
    <h1>Frictional character biography</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>When Marvel's distributor allowed them more monthly releases, The Avengers was developed as a new comic book
        series.[13] Iron Man was one of the five characters that formed the titular superhero team.[14] By 1965, the
        difficulty of maintaining continuity between The Avengers and the titles of the individual characters prompted
        Lee to write the original cast out of The Avengers, including Iron Man.</p> -->
